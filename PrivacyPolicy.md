# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: April 19, 2025

This Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The extension enhances the usability of https://usdb.animux.de by adding categorization features, enriching search results with additional song details, and assisting with metadata editing.

## Data Collection

The extension allows users to optionally provide a URL to a self-hosted configuration file (e.g., in cloud storage), which is stored locally in the browser.

The extension only accesses the provided URL to retrieve configuration settings and does not collect or transmit any user-specific content from the URL.

The extension does not track or record user activity, nor does it process any personal data related to browsing or online behavior.

## Local Storage

User preferences, such as selected categories and display settings, are stored locally using the browserâ€™s storage API.

No data is sent to external servers, and all configuration data is kept private to the user's local environment.

## Website Content

The extension only interacts with content on https://usdb.animux.de, a website for karaoke game songs. It does not collect or process data from any other websites or external sources.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not share or transmit any data to third-party services, advertisers, or other external entities.

## Data Security

All data handled by the extension is stored locally within the user's browser. No sensitive data is transmitted or stored externally.
